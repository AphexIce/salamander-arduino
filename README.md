### Project Aims

The aims of this project were to create a device which could be worn on a backpack to provide some basic information regarding temperature and altitude (and the possibility of extra functions later) in a waterproof enclosure, which is battery powered. In addition to this it would have to have the potential for the battery to be recharged via renewable energy.

#### Things to note

When originally testing the code for the adafruit BME280 sensor I found that it did not provide and accurate reading, I instead used the one from cactus.io (with thanks for all the hardwork) and rewrote sections of it to display the altitude. This can be found on the repository.
